The artificial barista program is a smart AI that allows users to order and customize their coffee. The program is reactive and dynamic, meaning that it can adapt to the user's input. For example, if the user enters their name, the program will use their name in the sentences. And if the user chooses a lot of sugar in their coffee, the program will react to that by saying to the user that they have a lot of sugar  in their coffee. this works on other ingrediants as well!

The program is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we order coffee. Imagine walking into a coffee shop and being able to order your coffee exactly the way you like it, without having to say a word.

***I wonder if the AI barista program can make me a coffee that will make me write better code?***
